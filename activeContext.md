# Current Active Context

## Primary Goal (MILESTONE 3: FINALIZATION)

**Refine architect.md + Complete remaining SOP sections based on audit findings**

### Milestone 2 COMPLETE ✅

System/ audit finished with no conflicts found:
- ✅ temporalHierarchy.md (domain-specific architect for Orbis)
- ✅ morningPagesGhostWorkflow.md (project-specific, marked stale paths for Audit Development)
- ✅ orbisLoreCreationWorkflow.md (project-specific, no conflicts)
- ⏭️ system/personas/ (skipped for later)

### Milestone 3: Finalization (Active Now)

**What's left to complete:**

1. **Review architect.md** for any refinements based on audit discoveries
   - Check if any new constraints emerged
   - Verify all sections are consistent
   - Ensure it's the true OS blueprint (not implementation details)

2. **Complete remaining SOP.md sections:**
   - Daily note procedures (read/update HOW — detailed workflow)
   - Memory management + flush protocol (implementation details)
   - Session startup HOW (step-by-step for users)
   - Complete references section

3. **Consistency pass** across all system/ docs
   - Ensure architect → SOP → workflows are aligned
   - Check that domain-specific docs (temporalHierarchy, morningPages, orbisLore) reference architect

4. **Document project switching protocol** (explicit instructions)
   - How to move from Context Recovery Architecture to next project
   - Symlink update procedure
   - Verification steps

5. **Mark Milestone 3 DONE** when verified

### Outcome Expected

- architect.md + SOP.md complete and production-ready
- Clear, repeatable protocol for managing concurrent projects
- Foundation solid enough to support Puppet Show + Audit Development
- System tested and validated with Context Recovery Architecture project

### Session Completion Criteria

- ✅ architect.md reviewed and finalized
- ✅ SOP.md sections completed
- ✅ All system/ docs coherent and cross-referenced
- ✅ Project switching documented
- ✅ Milestone 3 closed on GitHub
- ✅ Ready to begin next project (Audit Development)

### Time Remaining

Sunrise: ~7:15 AM EST (about 2 hours remaining in session)

## What Was Built This Session

✅ **architect.md** — Complete OS blueprint (context management, Definition of Done, mid-session ritual, recovery sequence)
✅ **SOP.md** — Operational manual with Project Context Management integrated
✅ **GitHub Projects** — Setup with 3 milestones, 5 issues created
✅ **Context Recovery Architecture** — Dedicated project folder + separate GitHub repo
✅ **decisionLog.md** — Running log of all system decisions (6 decisions documented)
✅ **System/ Audit** — 4 docs reviewed, no conflicts found
✅ **Gateway FD Leak** — Diagnosed (memory subsystem) and reported upstream

## Next Immediate Steps

1. Review architect.md (quick pass for consistency)
2. Complete SOP.md sections (daily procedures, memory management)
3. Consistency check across system/ docs
4. Close Milestone 3
5. Begin Audit Development (code repo inventory)
